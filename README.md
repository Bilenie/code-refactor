# code-refactor
##Description

-The motivation behind this project is a class challenge.

-I did the project to see my progress and what I learned so far in learning HTML and CSS.

-By following the Acceptance Criteria, 

    -I consolidated the CSS rule by following DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself).
    -I describe the images by adding an alt attributes.
    -I organize the HTML code following the general HTML/Semantic HTML rule.
    -I changed the selector name on the CSS file and matched the name of the class in HTML.
    -I added a comment to describe what I did on both HTML & CSS files.
